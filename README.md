Ray cast implementation similar to the game wolfenstein 3d
To compile untextured navigate to the untextured directory and run "make". Then run "./raycast".
Use arrow keys to navigate map
use "ctrl +" or "ctrl -" to change FOV(zoom in and out).
you can also try fisheye mode by running "./raycast fisheye"

Still working on the textured version

(most of the math was from the article above)
